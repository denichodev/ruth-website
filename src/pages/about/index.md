M-m-m..me?🥺

![picture of me](/img/websito.jpg "selca")

I dislike my natural black hair color, sometimes I do pink, sometimes I do purple, any moment later it could be a different color.

I might be not a 100% decent human being but I am a 100% decent cat mom.

My experience in this field is as young as that toddler that always cries and begs for only-god-knows-what in your flight it drives everyone crazy. 5 years 🙄. I really like the process to create something for brands. I think I really really really like it that 20 more years in this field is OK with me.



## But what do I do, exactly?

Copywriting

Content writing

UX writing

## Why do I care about good writing so much?

For me, writing is a design skill. No matter if it's on the interface or behind. We understand complex scenarios and explore different points of view through good writing. As technology becomes more personalised and automated, it’s even more important to make those pixels sounds more human.





I’m on my happiest from when I create things. Work with me!
