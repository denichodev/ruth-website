M-m-m..me?🥺

![picture of me](/img/websito.jpg "selca")

I dislike my natural black hair color, sometimes I do pink, sometimes I do purple, any moment later it could be a different color.

I might be not a 100% decent human being but I am a 100% decent cat mom.

My experience in this field is as young as that toddler that always cries and begs for only-god-knows-what in your flight it drives everyone crazy. 5 years 🙄. I really like the process to create something for brands. I think I really really really like it that 20 more years in this field is OK with me.

I’m on my happiest from when I create things. Work with me!
