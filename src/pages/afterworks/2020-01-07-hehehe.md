I can't function as a human being without munching on vegetables for days. I. need. them. to. cope. up.

Pokchoy, broccoli, radish, tomato, you name it. I'll eat it all. ðŸ˜¡

If I didn't thrive in this creative industry, my dream is to be a microgreens farmer.

Sometimes I get really drained behind the computer, even though I love what I do and have a good relationship with the internet. Little things like this is what keep me sane. I mean.. look at them. My tiny precious baby that soon will end up on my tummy ðŸ¥º imagine raising babies that you can actually eat ðŸ¥º

I've got to do something else, a secondary thing that re-energises me. So I started doing this. I have absolutely no plants/farm experience, but I found that as soon as I started, it was such a joy. I've always loved vegetables, plants, and foraging for stuff, but now I'm teaching myself plant names and what's what, and it's slowly turned into something else.

Growing this tiny veggies is like, you can have a play and see what happens. It's about not taking yourself too seriously.
