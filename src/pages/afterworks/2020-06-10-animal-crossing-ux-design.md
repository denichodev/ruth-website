I'm not a game person.. really. The only game that I play religiously is Dota 2.\
yed it religiously almost everyday for quite some times during my college years. Never played anything again, until Mr. Corona came and Nintendo release its newest version of Animal Crossing. Yay!

I thought virtually fishing, catching bugs, spent hours to pluck weeds and flowers would be therapeutic. But only after around 1 week of playing I realized something:  

> This is not therapeutic at all.

I have to grind so hard in this game. To do a task, I need to press at least 3 unnecessary buttons which often makes simple chores feel like a complete drag. Not to mention the several lines of dialogue required to get anything done. I'm looking at you, Orville. Why craft one at a time when you could craft in stacks? Why not have crafting benches inside your house linked to your storage? There's even a suggestion for how to speed up islanders' endless nattering.

This is where I input my caveat, I have never worked on a game before, honestly, I‚Äôm not even sure how a game is made. So I am writing these ‚Äúimprovements‚Äù with very little understanding of the constraints the development team at Nintendo/NDcube went through, so suggestions are made based solely on my personal assumptions and people‚Äôs playing experience I read on Twitter and Reddit.

## **Crafting Experience**

I believe this topic will resonate with most ACNH players. Much like the sorting mentioned above, a player can only craft each item, one by one, despite having the ingredients to craft multiple. This leads to a lot of clicking through repetitive, time-wasting interaction/dialogue.

Without dissecting the game‚Äôs crafting system, below is an illustration of what crafting multiple items could look like by introducing a quantity selector.

The players will only arrive at the quantity selector screen if they have enough resources to craft multiple items, otherwise, the player will enter into crafting animation from the previous screen after hitting ‚ÄúCraft it!‚Äù button.

Introducing a quantity selector like this will have a big impact on the player‚Äôs quality of life by creating time and effort saving value throughout the whole lifecycle of the player‚Äôs experience.

Another example of useful quantity selector placement (pic below) is when players need to grab something out of their pocket. No more grabbing items one by one. No more.

## Inventory Management

While there are no awards for best in-game inventory design (not that I know of‚Ä¶), a badly designed inventory can break a player‚Äôs flow. ([Great article by Jenova Chan on flow in games](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lieber/courses/cs4500/sp09/resources/p31-chen-flow-in-games.pdf))

In ACNH, the player‚Äôs inventory is a storage space with a fixed item limit which players upgrade as they progress. On multiple occasions, I found myself staring intensely at my hot-mess of an inventory, looking for the one item I wanted to sell. It was infuriating when I find out I‚Äôve missed something, and need to run back to the shop.

In ACNH, players have only one limited and hidden way to perform a sort function: by holding down the ‚ÄòA‚Äô button, selecting and dragging the items. ü§Ø

Taking the existing pattern that is already in the game, I re-designed the inventory to perform ‚Äòsort‚Äô like above, ‚Äî press Y to Sort. It follows how the ‚ÄúSort‚Äù function works in the game‚Äôs home storage, and crafting system.

Sort options include ‚Äî By Alphabetical, type and order obtained. This allows players to organize their inventory with ease, alleviating the pain when players need to perform activities such as buying/selling and gifting.



## Tools Durability Indicator

One of the ways ACNH sets itself apart from the previous titles in the Animal Crossing series is in how it handles tools. Every tool in the game now has a finite life span and breaks after a certain number of usage. This teaches the player to be more resourceful, and considerate about the usage of tools.

However, in ACNH, there is no obvious signs/indication of when a tool might break. The introduction to a durability indicator in the game‚Äôs coming updates would save players from countless upsetting moments.

As we step in uncharted UI territory for the AC series, I took inspirations from games like Minecraft, Legend of Zelda Breath Of The Wild to design a different way ACNH can introduce durability indicator:

Other than those mentioned above, I think there's a lot of room for improvements in ACNH's UI/UX design.

...

These designs are early concepts, none of them has been tested. Creating a new flow will require more player testing, with different items in the game and more scenarios/use cases.

By no means do I think these design changes are simple to implement, neither do I know the original intentions behind some of these decisions, but I believe changes like these will help players establish a routine by making key activities much easier and intuitive to perform, thus reduce the _‚Äúgrindy-ness‚Äù_ feel of the game.



Cheers!
