No.27 Coffee needed a campaign for their shift. As the brand want to take part in preserving the mama earth, we make social movement inside the store. No.27 Coffee gradually reduce their plastic waste, start with baby steps, replace plastic straws to metal. Look into the straw spectacles and you'll know.
