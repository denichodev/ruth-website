Perfecting the whole app redesign.

Working on the app's buttons, micro copies, and onboarding page.

I handled the UX writing and design, collaborated with one designer and other software engineers.

I stopped working on the project during the detailed visual design phase as the app started to be built.

The new redesigned app will launch in Google Playstore soon.
